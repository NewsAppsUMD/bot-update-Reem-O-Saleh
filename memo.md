This FDA Recalls Bot is a notification system that monitors the FDA's food enforcement API for new product recalls, analyzes them for severity level, and delivers formatted alerts to Slack. The recalls are prioritized by risk levels. 

I began the process by determining if it would be possible to reach the same goals for the app by using web scraping, but web scraping the FDA data is not possible, so I used the API. The first version was very simple and formatted the recalls into basic Slack messages. The Bot assesses the recalls based on priority. Once a recall message is sent out, it is stored in a JSON file to ensure recall messages are not repeating. The priority assessment is based on FDA classification, pathogen types, allergen severity, and distribution scope. There are high, low, and medium priority rankings, which are color coded for easy identification. 

Throughout development, I encountered and overcame several challenges. The FDA data was inconsistent, with distribution patterns and product descriptions varying in format and details. The FDA API is not updated as frequently as the website is. Slack message formatting was also difficult, particularly in resolving message duplication issues and ensuring consistent formatting. 

If the bot was able to accept user input, rather than simply receiving standardized alerts, users could engage directly with the bot through command-based queries within the Slack interface. Userss could search for specific keywords, filter recalls by allergen types or geographic regions, or request customized statistical summaries. As an example, a quality assurance manager at a dairy company might use commands like /recall-search milk contamination or /recall-filter allergen=dairy state=WI to quickly identify relevant recalls without going through unrelated notifications. Users can also provide preferences for the type of recalls they want to be informed of. 

A more useful version of the FDA Recall Bot would transform it from a notification system into a comprehensive food safety management tool. The bot could be used by a wider array of users like in warehousing it could feature inventory integration capabilities, cross-referencing recall information against current stock items. It would also provide structured incident response management. When a recall is identified, the system would generate comprehensive action plans with specific tasks for both consumers and companies.
